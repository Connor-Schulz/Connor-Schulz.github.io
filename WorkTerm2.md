## üìå Abstract

This report will outline the experience that I gained during my first co-op work term at Manulife. This report will provide context to the reader about the employer and job, relate my experience with my studies, and present my goals with the steps I took in order to achieve them.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Employer Info

The employer I worked for this term was Manulife Financial. Founded over 130 years ago, It is one of Canada‚Äôs oldest companies and is a leading international financial services group operating in over 13 countries worldwide. 
Manulife is a massive company with 34,000+ employees and 63,000+ agents that provide, create, and maintain a large variety of products and services ranging from asset management, wealth management, securities, commercial mortgages, and many more. 
Manulife prides itself in its ability to make lives better. This principle is reflected in their commitment to reinvest in the community, supporting health & well-being, inclusive economic opportunity, and creating a sustainable future.

## üèÜ Goals

The three goals that I chose for this work term were:

1. Help the team track dysfunctional parts of the application through the use of automated scripts
In my first few weeks on the team, I noticed how large of an effort it is for the content owners to maintain the hundreds of articles and forms that are provided to advisors. My solution to this was to write a script that could identify these issues quickly and accurately. Written in NodeJs, I ultimately planned for it to run periodically, giving the data to content admins to fix or validate any issues that were found. As I only had minimal experience with node prior to this placement, It was a great opportunity to ramp up on relevant technology and learn new skills. Due to limited time and some roadblocks caused by my limited knowledge, I wasn‚Äôt able to see it hit the automated stage, but I was able to get it almost fully functional and in a spot where another developer should be able to take on the project easily.

2. Become familiar with new technology
I chose this goal largely due to the fact that the application I was tasked with maintaining is written in Coldfusion, which, up until this point, I haven‚Äôt even heard of. Eager to start making contributions, I absorbed as much information about the syntax, semantics, and best practices as I could whilst I waited to gain access to internal systems. Within a few weeks, I was already comfortable reading / writing CFML and was making meaningful contributions to the back-end. Although I likely won‚Äôt be working with Coldfusion again in my career, the experience was extremely beneficial at showing that I‚Äôm capable of ramping up on unfamiliar technologies efficiently and accurately, something that I‚Äôm guaranteed to do several times in the future.  
   
3. Manage a release to a test environment
I decided this goal to try and gain more experience with releasing code. I was granted the opportunity to release to production at a previous placement but was aware that Manulife has much more strict policies regarding who is allowed to make these changes. That being said, I felt like releasing to an internal test environment would be much more realistic. As Manulife uses a much different process for releasing, I was able to gain new experience when it came to deploying, testing, debugging, and validating the changes. I pushed changes to the test environment several times in my short term. And even had the opportunity to co-pilot the team's lead engineer when he did production releases, giving me insight to the extra precautions that had to be taken.

## üìÉ Job Description

For this placement, I was tasked with improving a website that provides financial advisors with a solution to quickly find relevant documents and forms. 
As it was an old application, I was able to play a major role in updating the UI to align with company brand standards, Improve search logic and filtering to help connect advisors to the right forms with increased efficiency and accuracy, as well as identifying and creating solutions to major roadblocks and bugs. 
In the backend, I cleaned up unused code and assets, applied more consistent styling of the code, and redefined some processes and functions to improve efficiency, security, readability, and maintainability.
Internally, I created a script to help content managers identify common styling errors and any broken links that may need updating. This will hopefully help play a key role in keeping all the articles accurate and up-to-date.
I also participated in production releases and gave a demo presentation of new changes/features to senior employees and shareholders. 
The main technical skills required for this job were: HTML, CSS, JQuery, SQL, NodeJS, and Coldfusion. Besides the latter, I have had prior experience with all the technologies, either from class, a previous placement, or on my own time. I was able to learn Coldfusion fairly quickly on the job, by utilizing online tutorials and documentation as well as reading the already existing code in the backend.

## üèÅ Conclusions

In conclusion, in the short four month period that I worked at Manulife, I was able to learn new technology, contribute significantly to an important project that affected thousands of users, and improve the jobs of other employees. By choosing ambitious, but achievable goals, I was able to push myself beyond my experience and capabilities and do more than I could have imagined.

## üíå Acknowledgments

I would like to thank my direct manager, engineering lead, and product owner for helping support me and make this term a success. While everyone on the team was extremely helpful and friendly, these individuals contributed the most at helping get me oriented and productive.
