## üìå Abstract

This report will outline the experience that I gained during my fourth co-op work term. This report will provide context to the reader about the employer and job, and present my goals with the steps I took in order to achieve them.

## üèÜ Goals

The three goals that I chose for this work term were:

1. Contribute to reducing my team's backlog. <br>

	#### Goal
	Get onboarding done as quickly as I'm able to, and work on understanding the codebase so I can begin working on tickets and meaningfully contribute to reducing my team's backlog. Continue to build independence and confidence in my work as time goes on so that I can work on a greater number of tasks with increasing complexity.

	#### Measure of Success
	This will be considered successful If I've helped reduce the number of items in the team's backlog by a significant amount (~20 items or more) and if my turn-around time for tickets has decreased over time.

	#### Reflection
	Although I barely finished my goal for the end of the term (21 tickets completed) I didn't have the impact on the backlog that I was expecting. There are currently ~80 tickets in the backlog which is greater than when I started (~70 tickets). Although there were many factors that went into the growth of the backlog during this term that were beyond my control (namely the team's small size), I can say I managed to keep the backlog from shifting into the triple digits with the work that I was able to accomplish. I have been grabbing a greater amount of tickets as the term went on, some of which were extremely high priority, and I plan on working to continue this trend as I shift into my second work term at Arctic Wolf.

   <br>

2. Make meaningful contributions that help fight cyber crime (or) help assist others fight cyber crime <br>

	#### Goal
	During my term, I'd like to gain experience in understanding cybersecurity detections in a network context. With this knowledge, I should implement (or improve) solutions that can get approved for production and alert on detections that provide valuable knowledge to customers about threats in their network.
   
	#### Measure of Success
   The measure of success is that I've been able to take a request for a new detection through the entire process, from research, documentation, code implementation, review & verification, and finally production.

	#### Reflection
	With respect to the measure of success, this goal was not fully reached. I've gotten several detections to the verification stage, but none have been fully released to production. However, I still have made several meaningful contributions that involve tuning detections to be more accurate & cause less noise, Write and update alert templates for detections lacking one. I've also created a Slack channel with over 20 members that automatically alerts on external alert rule set updates.

   <br>

3. Create code improvements that use modern standards, improve maintainability, and improve organization + readability <br>

	#### Goal
   As a lot of the code was written in an older version of Python than we currently use, there's a lot of opportunity to improve the code in our repository. I'd like to use some of the more modern features that are available in Python (f-strings, bit-wise operators on sets, use of any()/all(), etc...) There are also code structure organization improvements that can be made such as refactoring certain functions and processes and reformatting the code to have uniform standards that'll improve readability.

	#### Measure of Success
   Merge code that improves the repository and will lead to better maintainability and readability in the future. This will likely need to be done alongside regular ticket work (2 birds with 1 stone) unless the team prioritizes just working on rewriting code.

	#### Reflection
	As the measure of success predicted, I would take a little bit of extra time with some tickets to make improvements to the code while I complete ticket work. I've re-formatted, modernized, and restructured several files that were included in PRs alongside new detections/tuning. I also researched and wrote a doc on potential code formatting tools that might get picked up and implemented at some point. This is something I want to continue doing during my second work term as it's usually very simple changes that carry a lot of future value.

<br>

## üìÉ Job Description

I worked as a Software engineer on Arctic Wolf's Network team. Much of my day-to-day consisted of creating and tuning detections relating to networks to further strengthen our coverage in that area. I also improved documentation, improved dev tools, and performed various research tasks varying from new cyber threats to code improvements.

I also became familiar with Arctic Wolf's Internal dashboards which I utilized to perform investigations to help solve problems and implement the correct security solutions.

<br>

## üèÅ Conclusions

In conclusion, my first four months at Arctic Wolf were incredibly humbling. It was the first time since I've started my first work term where I felt like I had more to learn than I brought to the table. This was primarily due to the major shift from web development into detection engineering and computer networking, both of which I had rudimentary knowledge on, if any at all. However, I think my ability to learn quickly and challenge myself managed to create a successful experience, even if it wasn't up to the high standard that I had set with my goals. Luckily, I still have another four months with this team at Arctic Wolf and I expect everything I've picked up thus far, will allow me to flourish during my Summer term.

## üíå Acknowledgments
I would like to thank my entire team to giving me an amazing introduction to such a massive, fast-moving, and daunting industry. The amount of combined knowledge and experience combined from everyone I was fortunate to work with this team has reinforced a pre-existing interest that I had in cybersecurity. I'd like to especially note my team lead and mentor, who went the extra mile to assist me with any weird issue or problem I faced.
